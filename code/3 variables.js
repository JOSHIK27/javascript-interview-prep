// we have 3 type of data containers let, var, const

const name = "JOSHIK" // has to initialised while declaring and cant be changed

// let and var has a minor difference in scope
// var is function scoped and let is block and function scoped
// var can be accessed outside the block and but not outside the function where it is declared
